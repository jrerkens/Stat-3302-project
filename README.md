# Stat-3302-project
Stat 3302 project, all designed to be ran in R.

An analysis of the `msleep` dataset from `ggplot2` using techniques from Stat 3302 at The Ohio State University. 
Here, we test the following hypotheses through multinomial analysis:

There is a relationship between diet category and total amount of sleep

There is a relationship between eating meat and total amount of sleep

There is a relationship between diet category and total amount of REM sleep

There is a relationship between eating meat and total amount of REM sleep

There is a relationship between diet category and ln(Body Weight)

There is a relationship between diet category and relative brain weight

There is a relationship between eating meat and relative brain weight

An interaction effect is needed to model the relation between brain weight, body weight, and diet category

There is a relationship between conservation level and total amount of sleep

There is a relationship between conservation level and ln(Body Weight)

There is a relationship between domesticated status and relative brain weight

There is a relationship between conservation level and relative brain weight
