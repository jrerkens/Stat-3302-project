# Stat-3302-project
Stat 3302 project, all designed to be ran in R.

An analysis of the `msleep` dataset from `dplyr` using techniques from Stat 3302 at The Ohio State University. 
Here, we test the following hypotheses:

1. Sleep cycle length can predict diet.
2. Total sleep length can predict diet.
3. Total numbers of REM sleep can predict diet.
4. Body weight can predict diet.
5. Brain weight can predict diet.
6. Amount of time spent awake can predict diet.
